### Personal statement

Hi there, my name is Kim and I spend a lot of my time trying to optimize things. I'm a busy gal and I like to do things as efficiently as possible and I hate repeating myself. I like to stay DRY, you know? I'm a relative new comer to the fitness world. My older brother tried to get me to join him and his buddies when we were in highschool, but I didn't want to get big muscles. I wish I would have joined him, because now I love it! Also, I wish gaining muscle mass is as easy as I thought it would be. I've been hitting the gym at least 3 times a week for almost 5 years now and I've only gained three pounds of lean muscle mass! Turns out, growing muscle is incrdibly difficult.

I've been trying to figure out ways to optimize my muscle growth in my spare time for years. It's really just an excuse for me to produce some awesome data visualiztions. I love unconvering patterns in the data I've produced over the past 5 years. Did you know, I burn 5% more calories when I run outside vs. running on a treadmill? Of course you didn't! and neither did I, until I crunched the numbers myself. Now I know I should favor running outside instead of the treadmill if I want to get the maximal results for my efforts. I love gaining actionable insights.

Lately, I've been trying to increase my squat PR by 10%. I set my current PR 3 weeks ago: I completed 2 reps of 80kgs at 125 pounds. I've been finding my old approaches to training aren't getting me the results I desire. I'm contemplating purchasing an advanced workout program or hiring a trainer because I really want to compete this year. My workout partner suggested I contact her trainer buddy, Evan, instead of purchasing a program and having to do it on my own. I'm thinking I'm going to take her advice and talk to her friend. Doesn't hurt right? Maybe he can help me exceed my goal?! Time will tell.
