### Business domain

Hates when people take a 5 minute phone break after each set

### Other people say
She quantifies every aspect of her life; she’s always trying to visualize her progress in life.

### Grokkability
* Wears a stainless steel Apple Watch (w/GPS and LTE) with a red sport strap
* Owns a red Inzer lever belt with custom black lever, a pair of white Adidas Adipower weightlifting shoes, and SBD knee sleeves
* Loves to share the results of her progress on IG

I think pointing out that she wears an Apple Watch highlights her interest in the latest tech. I chose the LTE model to indicate that she is always connected. The high-end weightlifting gear is meant to show that she is someone who takes weight training seriously. Her usage of IG conveys that she is a Millennial and likes to show-off a bit
