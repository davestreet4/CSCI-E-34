### Personal statement
Hi there. I'm Evan and I've been working as a personal trainer for over 13 years now. I've come across so many cool and interesting people in this profession. I love it and am extremely fortunate to do something I enjoy everyday. I really hope I inspire my clients to meet and exceed their goals.

I had a client cancel on me today. This isn't the the first time I've been cancelled on by this client. I know it's tough for him to keep a tight schedule due to work, but it would be awesome if I could just assign his workout to him and have him do it on his own time. Meh, maybe it wouldn't make a difference, but at least I'd have some idea how serious they are.

I remember when I was in school. I was just some lanky kid who looked like I did not belong in a weight room. I've come a long way since then! I own the weight room these days. I just wish others would recognize it took hard work to get here. I have some of my old workout journals over the years, if only people saw how many curls it took to get 25 inch arms, they'd understand none of this was given: it was earned; paid for with pain. My most successful clients understood that and recognized that they could replicate my success by putting in the time and hard work.

I'm actually running late right now. I just created a new HIIT workout routine that I want to try on myself before my group class this evening. Those are always fun! I love watching my people support each other in their goals. That reminds me, a friend of mine referred her friend to me the other day. Said her friend is super passionate about this workout thing and looking to compete soon, wish I could see her workout journal, it's the only way I can know for sure how serious she is.
