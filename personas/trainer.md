He’s not satisfied after a workout unless he’s sore the next day

### Grokkability
* Does his meal preps every Sunday after breakfast
* Uses MUJI double-ringed dot grid notebook
* Uses Vitamix bluetooth scale to portion out servings

I wanted to show that he is very organized in his life by calling out he does meal prep on Sunday. It’s also meant to convey he lives the lifestyle of an extremely fit person. His usage of a double-ringed notebook is important because it means he can set his notebook down without the notebook closing. The dot grid was specified to further drive home how organized he is. His bluetooth scale is meant to show that he’s not afraid to use tech when it saves him time and that he measures by weight (more precise).  This further re-enforces the structure in his life.

### Personal statement
Feels that a large part of his job is busy work.
