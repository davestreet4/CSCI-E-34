# Notes on personas

## Evan
### Bio
I chose the picture becasuse he was holding today's state-of-the-art technology: the clipboard.

I chose the name Evan Jackson because I used to workout with named Evan Jackson. Hopefully it communicates to the developers that he's a man with a last name.

The tag line came from a t-shirt we saw one day while working out. It resonated with us both, so it's become a thing.

I chose to make the trainer a guy because my other persona is a girl and I came up with that one first. The user population definitely consist of males, so I needed to make sure one of my personas represented that gender. The age 34, signifies an older Millenial. This allows the engineers to make some assumptions about his digital literacy: he remembers what life was like before mobile phones and the internet were ubiquitous. Evan is a dropout because he figured out what he wanted early in college in decided to take action instead of wasting time learning about some dead Russian author in his freshman literature class. I'd hope the developers would see that he's a go-getter who creates his own oppurtunities.

### Business domain info
> Has 8 consistent clients

I wanted to leave room for the possibility of him having more than 8 clients (they just aren't consistent!). I think it's important to highlight the number of consistent clients he has because that number is directly proporational to the amount of money he makes; the inconosistent clients limit the amount of clients he can have because they tend to book a session and not show up, causing him to miss out on working with others.

> Workout plans have a large HIIT component

HIIT was included to make sure developers understand that workout programs are more than just a list of exercises with set/rep info.

### Grokkability
> Does his meal preps every Sunday after breakfast

I wanted to show how structured an organized his life is, so I  that he is very organized in his life by calling out he does meal prep on Sunday. It’s also meant to convey he lives the lifestyle of an extremely fit person.

> Uses MUJI double-ringed dot grid notebook

His usage of a double-ringed notebook is important because it means he can set his notebook down without the notebook closing which saves time because he doesn't have to find where he left off everytime he picks up his notebook. The dot grid was specified to further drive home how organized he is.

> Uses Vitamix bluetooth scale to portion out servings

His smart scale is meant to show that he’s not afraid to use tech when it saves him time and that he measures by weight (more precise). This further re-enforces the structure in his life and his age. This may be agist, but I think most developers would assume a younger tech literate person would by a smart scale.

## Kim
### Bio
I chose the picture because it shows her with her phone and headphones, which should convey that she likes tech and would feel at home using a phone to track her progress.

I chose the name Kimberley Johnson because I know someone with that name. Hopefully it communicates to the developers that she's a female.

The tag line is supposed to show how committed she is to working out. She has a goal and will do whatever is needed to accomplish it. It's meant to convey to the developers that she could become a super user of the app.

I chose to make the client/athlete a girl because most of the girls I know prefer to hire a personal trainer. Even though this is anecdotal, it still serves to let the developers know females will be using the app. She is a younger millenial, so she's lived over half her life in the internet age. The developers can use that info to infer that she is likely tech-savvy. Her education is meant to re-enforce her tech savvyness, provide a potential reason for desire to quanitify her life,  and show that she would appreciate sophisticated data analysis and visualization. I think this tells the developers that people are going to want to see their progress, not just track it.

### Business domain info
> Personal goal is to increase squat PR by 10% (current PR is 80KG)

This conveys what her purpose in working out is. The devs should understand that most workout programs have an end-goal in mind.

> Currently weights 123lbs

Tells the developers that people are likely going to want to track their weight as well

> Favorite exercise is squat/Least favorite exercise is tricep pull-downs

I just wanted to re-enforce how much she enjoys working out.

### Grokkability
> Wears a stainless steel Apple Watch (w/GPS and LTE) with a red sport strap

I wanted to show that she is a very tech forward person. I chose the LTE model here to indicate that she is always connected and that she owns an iPhone.

> Owns a red Inzer lever belt with custom black lever, a pair of white Adidas Adipower weightlifting shoes, and SBD knee sleeves

The high-end weightlifting gear is meant to show that she is someone who takes weight training seriously.

> Loves to share the results of her progress on IG

Her usage of IG conveys that she is a Millennial and likes to show-off a bit.
