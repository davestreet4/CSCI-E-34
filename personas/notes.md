# Notes on personas

## Evan

I chose the name Evan Jackson because I used to workout with someone by that name. Hopefully it communicates to the developers that he's a man with a last name.

The tag line came from a t-shirt we saw one day while working out. It resonated with us both, so it's become a thing.

I chose to make the trainer a guy because my other persona is a girl and I came up with that one first. The user population definitely consist of males, so I needed to make sure one of my personas represented that gender. The age 34, signifies an older Millenial. This allows the engineers to make some assumptions about his digital literacy: he remembers what life was like before mobile phones and the internet were ubiquitous. Evan is a dropout because he figured out what he wanted early in college in decided to take action instead of wasting time learning about some dead Russian author in his freshman literature class. I'd hope the developers would see that he's a go-getter who creates his own oppurtunities.

I mentioned he has 8 consistent clients because I wanted to leave room for the possibility of him having more than 8 clients (they just aren't consistent!). I think it's important to highlight the number of consistent clients he has because that number is directly proporational to the amount of money he makes; the inconosistent clients limit the amount of clients he can have because they tend to book a session and not show up, causing him to miss out on working with others. I brought up HIIT because those workouts tend to be circuit based and performed against time. That line is there to make sure the developers don't go down a path thinking a routine is composed of just sets and reps.

I wanted to show how structured an organized his life is, so I  that he is very organized in his life by calling out he does meal prep on Sunday. It’s also meant to convey he lives the lifestyle of an extremely fit person. His usage of a double-ringed notebook is important because it means he can set his notebook down without the notebook closing which saves time because he doesn't have to find where he left off everytime he picks up his notebook. The dot grid was specified to further drive home how organized he is. His bluetooth scale is meant to show that he’s not afraid to use tech when it saves him time and that he measures by weight (more precise). This further re-enforces the structure in his life and his age. This may be agist, but I think most developers would assume a younger tech literate person would by a smart scale.

## Kimberley

I think pointing out that she wears an Apple Watch highlights her interest in the latest tech. I chose the LTE model to indicate that she is always connected. The high-end weightlifting gear is meant to show that she is someone who takes weight training seriously. Her usage of IG conveys that she is a Millennial and likes to show-off a bit
