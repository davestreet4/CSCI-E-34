> Reuben is in the middle of his workout and can easily log his progress.

Charlie is headed to the Apple store to have their geniuses migrate data from his 2015 MacBookPro onto his new 2018 MacBookPro that cost more than some people’s income. He’d typically do stuff like this on his own, but lately, Apple has been making it too complicated with their dongles. He feels his wrist buzz. _Reminder: GYM_. “Oh yeah, I need to get a case!”. He grabs a case for his new iPhone so he can track his workout without damaging it.

As he’s warming up on the Stair Master™, he’s checking out what today’s workout entails. HIT and agility work. His wrist pulses again, _Goal reached!_ Time to head out to the turf. After opening the app, he quickly taps the option to start the workout and waits for the stopwatch to signify the start of the workout. After his first interval. He opens the app. _Did you complete the interval?_ Today was tough; he has to be honest with himself and say no. Now he gets to input how much of it he completed quickly. His wrist buzzes. _30 seconds to next interval..._ He puts his phone down and get’s ready for the next round.
